## Instrumentation Testing : Espresso and UIAutomator

### Espresso Testing
Espresso, known for its effectiveness in instrumentation testing, serves as the primary tool for testing various aspects of the app's functionality. However, it has limitations when it comes to testing the placement of markers on Google Maps.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://developer.android.com/static/images/training/testing/espresso.png" alt="Mockito Logo" width="200">
</p>

Espresso helps you:

- Interact with views, like clicking buttons, sliding a bar, or scrolling down a screen.
- Assert that certain views are on screen or are in a certain state (such as containing particular text, or that a checkbox is checked, etc.).

#### Turn off animations

Espresso tests run on a real device and thus are instrumentation tests by nature. One issue that arises is animations: If an animation lags and you try to test if a view is on screen, but it's still animating, Espresso can accidentally fail a test. This can make Espresso tests flaky.

For Espresso UI testing, it's best practice to turn animations off (also your test will run faster!):

1) On your testing device, go to Settings > Developer options.
2) Disable these three settings: Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale.

</p>

### UIAutomator and Accessibility Node Info
Recognizing the importance of thoroughly testing Google Maps functionality, UIAutomator steps in. It leverages the AccessibilityService's tree of accessibility node info, which differs from Espresso's view hierarchy approach. This distinction allows UIAutomator to interact with UI elements that Espresso might not recognize, ensuring comprehensive testing of marker placements on the map.

### Why UIAutomator?
While Espresso navigates through the view hierarchy and processes all children of any ViewGroup, UIAutomator utilizes accessibility node info, which might not align one-to-one with the view hierarchy. This enables UIAutomator to identify and test views that might remain unrecognized by Espresso, especially crucial for accurate testing of Google Maps functionalities.

Our framework not only excels in UI testing with Espresso and UIAutomator but also extends its prowess to integration testing using the renowned Mockito framework.

## Integration Testing with Mockito

### What is Mockito?

Mockito is a powerful and flexible Java testing framework that simplifies the process of creating mock objects in unit tests. It plays a pivotal role in our integration testing strategy, allowing us to isolate and test components in a controlled environment.

Certainly! Let's break down the functionality of each test case in the `FakeMainActivityTest` class:

### `test_CompleteUserFlow()`

**Objective:** Verify a single user flow for a search query.

**Steps:**
1. Enter a search query.
2. Initiate the search.
3. Select a search result.
4. Place a marker on the map.
5. Confirm the marker placement.

**Validation:**
- Check for the presence of the marker on the map.
- Click on the marker.

**Description:**
This test case simulates a complete user interaction flow, ensuring that the application handles user inputs correctly, performs a successful search, displays search results, allows the user to select a result, and accurately places and confirms a marker on the map.

---

### `test_CompleteUserFlow_MultipleMarkers()`

**Objective:** Test multiple search results and place multiple markers on the map.

**Steps:**
1. Run the user flow for 5 search results.
2. Place 5 markers on the map.

**Validation:**
- Verify that the number of markers matches the number of search results.

**Description:**
This test case extends the previous one by iterating through multiple search results, placing markers on the map for each result, and ensuring that the count of markers corresponds to the expected number of search results.

---

### `test_Fix_InvalidLocationSearch_SpecialCharacters()`

**Objective:** Examine behavior with an invalid search query containing special characters.

**Steps:**
1. Enter an invalid search query.
2. Initiate the search.
3. Handle UI based on API responses.

**Description:**
This test case assesses how the application handles invalid search queries, particularly those containing special characters. It ensures that the UI provides appropriate feedback and displays specific messages when necessary.


**‚ö†Ô∏è Observation** : During testing, a noteworthy observation was made. When a user attempted to search for an invalid string, such as ($%^&), they encountered a list dialog displaying an evidently empty result. Since there was no option for the user to select from the results, and returning to the activity from the dialog was not possible, the user found themselves in a state where they were essentially unable to proceed within the app. This situation is illustrated in the screenshot below.

<p align="center"> <img width="260" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30040958/283721079-c56b8ed4-7509-4f5f-be4d-9895f5a0352e.png"></p>

**‚úÖ Fix** To maintain a seamless user flow and address this issue, a fix has been implemented. Now, if the Google Places API returns an empty result, the app no longer displays an empty result to the user. Instead, it presents an informative toast message, ensuring that users receive meaningful feedback and are not left stuck in an unresponsive state, as illustrated below.

<p align="center"> <img width="260" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30040958/283720803-a160b826-fa0f-4afc-8812-593590c4a7bd.png"></p>

**Steps:**
1. Enter an invalid search query.
2. Initiate the search.
3. Handle UI based on API responses.

**Validation:**
- Check UI behavior in case of API failures.
- Ensure specific messages are displayed.

**Description:**
This test case evaluates the application's response to API failures or lack of internet connection. It verifies that the UI provides clear feedback to the user in such scenarios, displaying informative messages as needed.

---

These test cases collectively cover a range of scenarios, including successful user interactions, handling multiple search results, addressing issues with invalid queries, and managing failures related to the API or internet connection.

#### Scalable Framework Consideration

The introduction of the `test` directory, even with a single test (`SearchViewModelTest`), demonstrates the scalability of the testing framework. By segregating different types of tests into dedicated directories (`androidTest` and `test`), we establish a foundation for expanding and enhancing test coverage as the application evolves. This separation ensures a structured and scalable testing environment, accommodating future testing needs and maintaining the reliability of the application's codebase.
